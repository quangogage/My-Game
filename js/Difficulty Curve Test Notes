Difficulty curve log.



------------------------------------------
Test 001:
------
Max Enemies:

  - Rate: 0.07
  - Max: 10

Spawn Rate:

  - Rate: 6
  - Min: 50 / 100


Conclusion:

  The way the new values are calculated is exponential. Which is not intended.
  It should be a kind-of-similar-to linear curve.

  Need to think of a better way to increase the values.

------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------
Test 002:
------
  Notes:
  I have made the way difficulty increases linear. There is a timer that is
  continuously incrementing. Once it gets past a certain value, "Trigger Rate,"
  all of the values are increased once by there "Rate" property, and the
  timer is reset to zero.
------
  Max Enemies:

  - Rate: 0.1
  - Max: 10

  Spawn Rate:

    - Rate: 0.25
    - Min: 50 / 100


  Conclusion:

    Overall, the progression was too slow.

    The Spawn Rate increased *FAR* too slowly. It probably would have taken 5
    minutes to get it below 290 (it starts at 300.)

    The Max Enemies was better, but still just a little slow..Maybe?

------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------
Test 003:
------
  Max Enemies:

  - Rate: 0.12
  - Max: 10

  Spawn Rate:

    - Rate: 0.75
    - Min: 50 / 100


  Conclusion:

    The Spawn Rate couldn't keep up with the Max Enemies.

    Either need to decrease the Max enemies rate, or increase the 
    Spawn Rate.

------------------------------------------



------------------------------------------
Test 004:
------

  Decreased Max Enemies,
  Increased Spawn Rate

  Max Enemies:

  - Rate: 0.085
  - Max: 10

  Spawn Rate:

    - Rate: 1.2
    - Min: 50 / 100


  Conclusion:
  Max Enemy and Spawn Rate increasing difficulty felt better matched,
  but overall it felt far too slow. Need to increase both while mainting
  a good balance.
